# Markdown Converter
Just run `./convert_markdown.rb README.md` and it will generate a nice HTML and PDF file.

You can also run it like this

```bash
$ ruby convert_markdown.rb README.md
```

But I'm only saying this so I can have a typed syntax section in my Readme so I can use
it as an example markdown file too.

What the hell, here's another one:

```ruby
text = 'some ruby string'
# a comment
num = 12 * 34
text = "#{text}. oh look a number too: #{num}"
puts text.upcase
```

### Why?
Because it's plain and simple and I like that.

Go checkout https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide ... I stole most of the code from there ;) Thanks guys!
